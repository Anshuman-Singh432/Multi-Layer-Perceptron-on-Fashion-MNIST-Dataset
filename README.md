# Multi-Layer-Perceptron-on-Fashion-MNIST-Dataset
# I used the MLP to train neural netowork on Fasion MNIST Dataset, I performed hyperparamter tuning on learning rate.
# I used Grid search CV to find the best learning rate
# I then used two real world images to test the model after training and model performed well on one of the images.
# Further suggestions are given to improve the model.
# It genereally starts overfitting after the 5th Epoch so techniques like Data Augmentation, Early stopping should be applied to prevent overfit.
